                <div class="about-p1">Before 1956, Casper did not have an organized humane organization to care for
                    homeless animals. Velma Funda saw the need for one and in 1956, she established a network of foster
                    homes where animals were cared for until permanent homes were found. </div>
                <div class="about-p2">After several years of fundraising, the present "state of the art" shelter was
                    opened in 2003.</div>
                <div class="about-p3">Mission:</div>
                <div class="about-p2">It is the purpose of the Casper Humane Society to find homes for homeless animals,
                    to encourage the neutering and spaying of pets, to prevent and alleviate cruelty to animals, and to
                    provide humane education to the community.
                </div>
                <div class="about-p2">
                    The Humane Society feeds and cares for homeless and unwanted animals in the Casper and surrounding
                    areas. We provide medical care, shelter and love to those who have been abandoned, lost or
                    surrendered to us.
